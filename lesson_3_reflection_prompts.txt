When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When it is a project that is being developed with another people, or when we need to access it from a different
computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
When the collaborators are working on different features don't want to update the remote until the local repository is 
ready and working.
