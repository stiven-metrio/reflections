When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When it is a project that is being developed with another people, or when we need to access it from a different
computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
When the collaborators are working on different features don't want to update the remote until the local repository is 
ready and working.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies on GitHub
Clones are copies on our local machine
Branches are versions on GitHub and our local machines
