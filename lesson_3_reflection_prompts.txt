When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When it is a project that is being developed with another people, or when we need to access it from a different
computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
When the collaborators are working on different features don't want to update the remote until the local repository is 
ready and working.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies on GitHub
Clones are copies on our local machine
Branches are versions on GitHub and our local machines

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remotes stored locally?
It allows us to know if our local repository is ahead of our remote repository, and to merge the local and remote
branches in an eassier way.

How would you collaborate using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
In order to collaborate, it is necessary to use an online platform, so GitHub would be the best option.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefit does each approach have?
When we are working for the first time in a new feature or change that we are not completely sure.
The benefit is that we won't broke the main branch if an error occurs.
